### [Problem](https://www.luogu.org/problem/show?pid=2375)

### 解法
First calculate z-function.  At position $x$,
if $z[x] > 0$, the substring starting from this position will contribute 1 to $\textrm{num}[q]$ for $q\in [x, x+L-1]$, where $L = \min(x, z[x])$ to avoid overlap. We can use a segment tree or Fenwick tree to add the contribution to the range.
