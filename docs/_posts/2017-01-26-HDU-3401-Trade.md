### [Problem](http://acm.hdu.edu.cn/showproblem.php?pid=3401)

### Solution
Let $dp(d, s)$ denote the maximum amount of money we can have on day $d$ with
$s$ shares. Three cases

* We don't trade on day $d$, then $dp(d,s)=dp(d-1,s)$.
* We buy some shares, then ($A$ is the buy price and $C$ is maximum number of
  shares we can buy)

$$
\begin{align*}
dp(d,s)&=\max\limits_{j=s-C}^{s}(dp(d-W-1,j)-(s-j)\cdot A) \\
&=\max\limits_{j=s-C}^{s}(dp(d-W-1,j)+j\cdot A) - s\cdot A
\end{align*}
$$

* We sell some shares, it's similar

In case 2 and 3, we can use monotonous queue optimization.  Total runtime
is $O(T\cdot \textrm{maxP})$.
